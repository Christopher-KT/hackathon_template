## User Economy Protocol

Unster incorporates the MMOSH token economy for a decentralized, permissionless, and composable user Economy protocol.

### Token Primitives

1. **Profiles**: NFTs for contextual user identity
2. **Badges**: Fungible assets for relationship maintenance
3. **Passes**: NFTs for token-gated Unster incidents access
4. **Coins**: Fungible tokens for liquidity pools and bonding curves

### Economy

- **Token**: MMOSH
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000,000 (10 billion)

### Earning MMOSH Tokens

- Contributing storage space
- Validating transactions
- Developing protocol improvements
- Providing computational resources
- Creating content
